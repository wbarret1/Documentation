Documentation for CAPE-OPEN Interface Specifications.

At present, the site contains 4 versions of the Manager Common Interface Specifications, all of which were saved from the word .docx file.

The Markodwn version was created using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert the Word document to Github-flavored Markdown.

The remining versions were the result of performing a "Save As" to the web page type directly in Word.

The Index page for the documentation site is: [https://wbarret1.github.io/Documentation/](https://wbarret1.github.io/Documentation/).
